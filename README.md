# Grad_Funding

Hello! For those who don't know me, my name is Caelan Johnson, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Arnott lab at Queen's university. I've been working on a data visualization for the education of the Biology department at Queen's University regarding the financial situation for graduate students, focusing on comparing the disposable income of grad students that receive the minimum departmental funding to Canada's poverty metric, the Market Basket Measure (MBM). I've done a bit of work here to feel confident that what I'm sharing with the public is a fair representation. My goal is to present this information as honestly as possible, avoiding sensationalization. Because of this, if I learn of errors in my work, or ways to improve it, I will do my best to update this repository as I am able.

I'm relatively new to GitHub and especially public repositories, so if there is a way for me to receive suggested improvements, I will look at them--though I currently don't know how that would work.

The file to check out for the current progress on this effort is the Plotting_Stipend_MBM.pdf file.
